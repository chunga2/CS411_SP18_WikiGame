# WikiRacer

## Description

We want to implement a WikiRacing game.  The game is as follows:
1. Users join a game, and are given a start point and end point.  They are presented with an interface that looks like [this](https://luke.deentaylor.com/wikipedia/).
2. Users must find a path through the graph from the start article to the end article.  Every time they expand an article, they are presented with a graph showing more articles.  The database tracks clicks.
3. When everyone finds a path, the game ends.  The people who expanded the fewest links win.
The database should track all of this, and be used to present visualizations and leaderboards.

## Usefulness:

We believe that this game represents an interactive way to explore Wikipedia, one of the best sources of information about a variety of topics, and find out about more topics and articles that they may not have known about before. Furthermore, our recommendation features would help them find more relevant articles and information for them to explore once they are done playing the game.

## Realness:

Out data will be parsed from Wikipedia. These data are publically available online. We will use a web crawler to crawl through wikipedia and create associations between links.

## Functionality:
Basic functions:

Provide a forum of each course in UIUC  for users to ask and answer questions. Update the forums before each semester according to latest course information from university website. Allow students to review and score each course for different aspects such as difficulty and workload.
Get real data by both crawling the university website and generated by real users. Crawling the university website for course data to set up forums. Inserting real Q&A data by students around us.
Set up the basic database structures for course information, user information and posts. Insert, update and delete records of the database when user generating, editing or removing posts. Querying records according to different attributes such as post date, keyword, topic.

### Advanced functions:
- Visualization

- After a user plays each round of the game, we want to generate 3 visualizations of the subset of the graph of articles that was relevant to the round that was played. One visualization would display the most optimal (shortest) path between the starting and ending articles. Another visualization would display the most commonly traveled path based on other users that have played the same round. Another visualization would display the overall user’s path and what other possible options they had. In this way, they can compare their performance with the most optimal solution and other people’s solutions, to understand how they can improve from round to round.
Post filter

- Web Crawler and Mapping

- Another advanced feature would be a recommendation engine .  ties in directly with how we’ll be creating our web crawler. Part of the problem in this game is we might start the user at a too easy or hard node and end too hard or easy. So we plan to have a way to associate each web page within categories by some method to ensure that we can have a game of reasonable difficulty. With this map, we can recommend to the user other articles that they may be interested in to provide tangential learning. We could do this by a text-to-vector method to create a graph of the links of Wikipedia.
